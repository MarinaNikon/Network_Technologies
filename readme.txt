	This is " Server and client applications with the Java Socket API" program. With the help of this program
clients communicate with the server and through the server can communicate with each other.
The Server should be run first. When the message "Server Started" appears, the client could be run. 
The client can be launched multiple times, thus adding a new client to the conversation.
Each new client receives 10 previous messages upon connection. In order to exit the conversation, the client needs to write "quit".
